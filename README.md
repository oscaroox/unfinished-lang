# Unfinished lang

![tests](https://github.com/oscaroox/unfinished-lang/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

Unfinished-lang is a general-purpose programming language written in Rust. Currently, it features a tree walk interpreter that allows you to write and run Unfinished-lang code directly in the command line. In the future, the language will be compiled to bytecode and executed in a custom stack-based virtual machine for improved performance.

The language takes inspiration from several modern programming languages, including Rust, Swift, Kotlin, C#, and TypeScript. It is designed to be both simple and expressive, offering a clean and readable syntax while supporting modern programming paradigms like functional programming and object-oriented programming.

Unfinished-lang currently features a basic set of built-in data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and boolean values. It also includes support for control flow structures like loops and conditional statements, as well as functions with optional and default arguments.

As the name suggests, Unfinished-lang is a work in progress....
